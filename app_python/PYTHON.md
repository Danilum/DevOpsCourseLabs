# Best DevOps practices

- Automate everything. Automation reduces time spent on that task in the future and risk of human error
- Keep infrastructure in a codebase – by doing that, recreation is simpler and you get a good understanding of the infrastructure stack that you create. Moreover, any changes can be checked/audited through commit history
- Always test your code
- Keep your environments as similar as possible – it enables us to identify and mitigate any potential issues before deploying on production. In fact, it’s best to use an environment which is as similar to production as possible
- Be up-to-date with newest technology trend
- Deliver quickly, rollback even quicker
- Provide developers with tools that help them work best
